# Plugin to set default template for every new note.

I've made it for personal use, but maybe it can be useful for other Obsidian users.
It is very simple. It just writes the text from plugin settings to a newly created empty .md files.

### Installation

This is a usual Obsidian plugin. Clone or unzip into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory, then enabled in the Obsidian configuration and specify you template in the plugin settings.
